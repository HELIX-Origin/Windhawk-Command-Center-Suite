## 📜 Tracking Rules

- **No Typo Duplication**: When recording user reports, clean and fix all typos to preserve professional quality.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent formatting and style throughout all documentation to ensure readability and professionalism.
- **Clear Sectioning**: Use clear and descriptive headers for each section to improve navigation and readability.
- **Active Items First**: The currently active milestone, sprint, task, or workstream must always be placed at the top of the content sections.
- **Regular Updates**: Ensure that the roadmap is regularly updated to reflect the latest developments and changes in the project.
- **Improve User Directives**: Continuously refine and clarify user directives to ensure they are easily understood and actionable.
- **Universal Direct Store Links**: Every game alert, giveaway, or deal **MUST** resolve to the actual storefront page of the game.
- **Always Track Everything**: Every new feature request, enhancement, or bug report must be logged in [`BUGS.md`](./BUGS.md), [`TODO.md`](./TODO.md), and [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) before execution.
